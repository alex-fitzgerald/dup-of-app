Hi,

This is an app I created for myself to provide random daily goals and reminders. 

I find it useful - like a billboard that is quickly tuned out after seeing it every morning, the same reminders or goals every day can become just 'noise'. I find some variety and randomness keeps them more engaging.

It's all built in React, Express, Mongo and Node.  

I have yet to add some extra functions and clean up the code. There's still refactoring to be done, adding comments to my own work, and seperating out stylesheets for specific components.

Alex
