Hi,

This is an app I created for myself to provide random daily goals and reminders. 

I find it useful - like a billboard that is quickly tuned out after seeing it every morning, the same reminders or goals every day can become just 'noise'. I find some variety and randomness keeps them more engaging.

It's all built in React, Express, Mongo.  

There's a lot of dead code in there, a lot of refactoring to do (a lot off the one big server file into smaller parts), adding styled-components, etc. 

It was a great project to put together and a great way to learn some of the fundamentals of React! 

Next steps would be implementing Redux and Routing, two things I've worked after deploying the initial version of this app.

I have yet to add some extra functions and clean up the code. There's still refactoring to be done, adding comments to my own work, and seperating out stylesheets for specific components. The code itself is a mess, and should be tidied up at some point! 

Alex
